# DevOps Questions
## What are the key benefits of DevOps and how can we utilise them (provide use cases or examples)?

1) Cultural Bnefits - Happier, more productive teams, better communication within different teams
2) Cross functionality due to working in collabaration with other teams
3) CI/CD allows for better code practices, getting more tasks done, delivers reults faster (fequent code deployments)
4) Devops adds business value and reduces cost effiency




### DORA’s 2019 State of DevOps Report show that top DevOps performers deliver code faster, have fewer issues, and resolve incidents more quickly:

## What is public cloud, Hybrid cloud and private cloud (use cases)
1) Public Cloud - This is the most common type of cloud computing deployment. The resources such as servers and storage are owned by thrid party cloud service providers and are delivered over the internet. Examples of this of AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. 

Benefits:-
  - Lower Costs - As no hardware/software need to purchased. 
  - No maintenance - Service Providers does that for you
  - Near Unlimited Scalability - On demand resources are available to meet your business needs. 
  - High Reliablity - A vast netwrok of servers ensures against failue

2) Hybrid Cloud - This type of cloud infrastructure provides the best of both words, as valuable and confidential information can be stored locally(personal servers in buildings) and all other publically available information can be stored on a public cloud. A hybrid cloud platform gives organisations many advantages such as greater flexibility, more deployment options, security, compliance and getting more value from their existing infrastructure.

Benefits:-
  - Control – your organisation can maintain a private infrastructure for sensitive assets or workloads that require low latency.
  - Flexibility – you can take advantage of additional resources in the public cloud when you need them.
  - Cost-effectiveness – with the ability to scale to the public cloud, you pay for extra computing power only when needed.
  - Ease – transitioning to the cloud doesn’t have to be overwhelming because you can migrate gradually – phasing in workloads over time.
